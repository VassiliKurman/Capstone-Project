# Capstone-Project
This is Project 6 from Android Developer Nanodegree program developed by Udacity with Google partnership

## Project Overview

In the Capstone project, I will build an app of my own design in two stages. In Stage 1 I design and plan the app using a template that Udacity provided in the "Instructions" node.

Through this project, I'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:
* An app description
* UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like the Popular Movies overview
* A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order

The Capstone project gives the experience I need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.

## Project Specification

Capstone, Stage 1 - Design

### Common Project Requirements
* App is written solely in the Java Programming Language
* App utilizes stable release versions of all libraries, Gradle, and Android Studio.

### Design and Plan Review
* Proposal contains an overview description.
* Proposal contains a description of the intended user.
* Proposal contains user interface mocks.(*including a UI mock for the app's widget)
* Proposal declares the appâ€™s primary features.
* Proposal outlines any key constraints such as data persistence, UX corner cases, and libraries used. App clearly outlines how a database will be implemented.
* Proposal describes a plan to implement the main features of the app via a set of well structured technical tasks.
* UI mocks depict interaction stories that adhere to Core App quality guidelines.
* App design specification demonstrates implementing all features required for Project 7: Capstone, Stage 2 - Build.
