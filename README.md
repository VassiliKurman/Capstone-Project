# Capstone-Project

## Project Overview

In the Capstone project, I will build an app of your own design in two stages. In Stage 1, I design and plan the app, using a template that Udacity provided in the "Instructions" node.

Through this project, I'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:

    * An app description
    * UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like the Popular Movies overview
    * A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order

The Capstone project gives the experience I need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
